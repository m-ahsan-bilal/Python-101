# Fine tuning a LLM
Fine tuning a large language model (LLM) involves adjusting the model's parameters on a specific dataset to improve its performance on tasks relevant to that dataset. This process typically requires a substantial amount of computational resources and expertise in machine learning.

# Steps to Fine Tune a LLM
1. **Select a Pre-trained Model**: Choose a pre-trained LLM that serves as the base for fine-tuning. Common choices include models like GPT-3, BERT, or T5.
2. **Prepare the Dataset**: Collect and preprocess the dataset that you want to use for fine-tuning. This dataset should be relevant to the tasks you want the model to perform.
3. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries and frameworks installed, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with the specific libraries for the LLM you are using (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers).
4. **Configure the Training Parameters**: Define the hyperparameters for training, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and any specific configurations required by the model.
5. **Fine-tune the Model**: Use the training dataset to fine-tune the model. This involves running the training loop where the model learns from the dataset, adjusting its weights based on the loss calculated from its predictions.
6. **Evaluate the Model**: After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset. This helps to ensure that the model has learned effectively and is not overfitting.
7. **Save the Fine-tuned Model**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, save the fine-tuned model for future use. This typically involves saving the model architecture and its weights.
8. **Deploy the Model**: Finally, deploy the fine-tuned model to a production environment where it can be used for inference on new data.

## Installation

Create conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n finetune_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate finetune_env
```

Install libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Fine tune model

To fine-tune a model, you can use the provided script. Make sure to adjust the parameters according to your dataset and model requirements.
```bash
python src/finetune.py
```

After running the script, the fine-tuned model will be saved in the specified directory. You can then use this model for inference or further training.
# Example of using the fine-tuned model
```bash
cd src
python inference.py
```

This will load the fine-tuned model and allow you to perform inference tasks. Make sure to adjust the model path in the script if necessary.
